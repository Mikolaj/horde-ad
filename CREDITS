Conal Elliott, talking beautifully about the Essence of Automatic Differentiation

Simon Peyton Jones, who sketched in "Provably correct, asymptotically efficient, higher-order reverse-mode automatic differentiation" talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPGqzkEZWyw algorithms that this Haskell codebase implements, focusing on translating Haskell code into a form with derivatives

Faustyna Krawiec, Neel Krishnaswami, Tom Ellis, Andrew Fitzgibbon, Richard Eisenberg, the remaining authors of the paper "Provably correct, asymptotically efficient, higher-order reverse-mode automatic differentiation" from POPL 2022 that describes an AD translation of a functional code (allegedly, eventually to C++), including some ingenious algorithmic ideas this Haskell codebase implements

Oleg Grenrus, whose https://hackage.haskell.org/package/overloaded contain inspiring examples related to AD

Edward Kmett, author of the archetype Haskell ad library
