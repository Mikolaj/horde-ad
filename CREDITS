Conal Elliott, talking beautifully about the Essence of Automatic Differentiation

Simon Peyton Jones, who sketched in "Provably correct, asymptotically efficient, higher-order reverse-mode automatic differentiation" talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPGqzkEZWyw algorithms that this codebase implements in Haskell and for Haskell

Faustyna Krawiec, Neel Krishnaswami, Tom Ellis, Andrew Fitzgibbon, Richard Eisenberg, the remaining authors of the paper "Provably correct, asymptotically efficient, higher-order reverse-mode automatic differentiation" from POPL 2022 that reportedly contains or describes an implementation of AD that translates a functional code to C++

Oleg Grenrus, whose https://hackage.haskell.org/package/overloaded contained inspiring examples related to AD
