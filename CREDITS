Conal Elliott, talking beautifully about the Essence of Automatic Differentiation

Simon Peyton Jones, who sketched in "Provably correct, asymptotically efficient, higher-order reverse-mode automatic differentiation" talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPGqzkEZWyw algorithms that this Haskell codebase implements translating into Haskell and for use in Haskell

Faustyna Krawiec, Neel Krishnaswami, Tom Ellis, Andrew Fitzgibbon, Richard Eisenberg, the remaining authors of the paper "Provably correct, asymptotically efficient, higher-order reverse-mode automatic differentiation" from POPL 2022 that describes an AD translation a functional code to C++, including some amazing algorithmic ideas this Haskell codebase implements

Oleg Grenrus, whose https://hackage.haskell.org/package/overloaded contained inspiring examples related to AD
