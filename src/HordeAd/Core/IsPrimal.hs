-- | The class relating the primal datatype to its dual counterpart
-- and the instances of the class for all kinds it's going to be use at
-- (@Nat@ and @[Nat]@). This class abstract over some of the operations
-- involving primal and dual components of dual numbers, most importantly
-- the @Share@ operations for sharing delta expressions, regardless
-- of the typing of the tensors being used (ranked vs shaped).
--
-- This module uses and rather safely encapsulates impure side-effects.
-- The impurity produces pure data with a particular property.
-- The property is an order of per-node integer identifiers that represents
-- data dependencies and sharing between delta expressions. The low-level API
-- depends on this property, but is completely isolated from the impurity.
-- The high-level API triggers the impurity but can't observe
-- any impure behaviour. Neither can any other module in the package,
-- except for the testing modules that import testing-exclusive class instances
-- and operations for reading or reseting the impure counter.

-- * The IsPrimal class and its instances

-- | The class states that @f r z@ type is the primal component
-- of a dual number as exeplified by the operations.
--
-- The OfShape hacks are needed to recover shape from ranked tensors,
-- in particular in case of numeric literals and also for forward derivative.
type IsPrimal :: TensorType ty -> Type -> ty -> Constraint
class IsPrimal f r z where
  dZeroOfShape :: f r z -> Dual f r z
  dScale :: f r z -> Dual f r z -> Dual f r z
  dAdd :: Dual f r z -> Dual f r z -> Dual f r z
  intOfShape :: f r z -> Int -> f r z
  sharePrimal :: f r z -> f r z  -- impure
  shareDual :: Dual f r z -> Dual f r z

-- | The instances are impure, because 'shareDual'
-- adorns terms with an @Int@ identifier from a counter that is afterwards
-- incremented (and never changed in any other way).
--
-- The identifiers are not part of any non-internal module API
-- and the impure counter that gets incremented is not exposed
-- (except for low level tests). The identifiers are read only in internal
-- modules. They are assigned here once and ever accessed read-only.
-- Their uniqueness ensures that subterms that are shared in memory
-- are evaluated only once. If pointer equality worked efficiently
-- (e.g., if compact regions with sharing were cheaper), we wouldn't need
-- the impurity.
--
-- Given that we have to use impurity anyway, we make the implementation
-- faster by ensuring the order of identifiers reflects data dependency,
-- that is, parent nodes always have higher identifier than child nodes.
-- The @StrictData@ extension ensures that the implementation of the instances
-- are call by value, which is needed for that identifier ordering.
--
-- As long as "HordeAd.Core.Delta" is used exclusively through
-- smart constructors from this API, the impurity is completely safe.
-- Even compiler optimizations, e.g., cse and full-laziness,
-- can't break the required invariants. On the contrary,
-- they increase sharing and make evaluation yet cheaper.
-- Of course, if the compiler, e.g., stops honouring @NOINLINE@,
-- all this breaks down.
--
-- The pattern-matching in 'shareDual' is a crucial optimization
-- and it could, presumably, be extended to further limit which
-- terms get an identifier. Alternatively, 'HordeAd.Core.DualNumber.dD'
-- or library definitions that use it could be made smarter.

-- This is the only operation directly touching the single impure counter
-- that holds fresh and continuously incremented integer identifiers,
-- The impurity in this module, stemming from the use of this operation
-- under @unsafePerformIO@, is thread-safe, admits parallel tests
-- and does not require @-fno-full-laziness@ nor @-fno-cse@.
-- The only tricky point is mandatory use of the smart constructors
-- above and that any new smart constructors should be similarly
-- call-by-value to ensure proper order of identifiers of subterms.
--
-- We start at a large number to make tests measuring the size of pretty
-- printed terms less fragile. @Counter@ datatype is just as safe,
-- but faster than an @MVar@ or an atomic @IORef@ (and even non-atomic @IORef@).
-- The operation is manually inlined to prevent GHCs deciding otherwise
-- and causing performance anomalies.
